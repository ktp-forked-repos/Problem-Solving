{"name":"Problem-solving","tagline":"Solving problems from different sites such as geeksforgeeks, leetcode and online judges","body":"### Searching on the Repository\r\nTo implement searching based on tags we added meta to each of the source file. During search have to append `tag-` as prefix of the tag string. For example to search on problems on linked-list: you navigate to [this repo url](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/) and enter following on search box: `tag-linked-list`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, here are the currently supported tags on algo/data structure based domains,\r\n * [Binary Search](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-binary-search)\r\n * [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-dynamic-programming)\r\n * [Linked List](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-linked-list)\r\n * [Priority Queue](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-priority-queue)\r\n * [Sorting](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-sorting)\r\n * [Recursion](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-recursion)\r\n * [String](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-string)\r\n\r\nCompany based domains,\r\n * [Google](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-google)\r\n \r\nMiscellaneous tags\r\n * [Interviews, any company](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-interviews)\r\n * [Easy problems, can't classify](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-easy)\r\n \r\n### Problem Solving Repository Structure\r\n#### Basics\r\nContains some basic idea and implementation.\r\nFor example,\r\n * swap and overflow limit tests\r\n * Sorting algorithms\r\n\r\n#### Algorithms\r\nRelated with implementation of algorithms.
